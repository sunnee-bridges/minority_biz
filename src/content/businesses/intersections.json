  "notes": "Upscale Southern-inspired restaurant that offered refined takes on comfort food classics. Their menu featured dishes like blackened striped bass with corn cream and jalapeño spoon bread, citrus-brined Cornish game hen with cornbread stuffing, and lobster étouffée. Vegetarian options included cauliflower katsu with Japanese curry and grilled artichoke with lemon aioli. The restaurant appears to have closed in 2022 and has been searching for a new location since then. Status: Temporarily closed, seeking new location."
