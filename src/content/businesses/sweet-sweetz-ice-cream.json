  "notes": "Sweet Sweetz Ice Cream is a family-run dessert shop led by Lodene Turner and her daughters, Erin and Jamie. This spot scoops up a wide range of Blue Bell ice cream flavors alongside house-made treats like chocolate-covered pretzels, fruit pies, and cobblers. Beyond dessert, Sweet Sweetz creates a warm, positive place for kids, families, and neighbors to gather. The shop itself is a true passion project for Lodene, whose childhood nickname, “Sweet Sweetz,” inspired the name."
