  "notes": "Jabo's has been serving pit-smoked Louisiana-style barbecue since 1992. Husband-and-wife team Jabo and Susan create everything from scratch using family recipes with no preservatives or MSG. All meats are slow-smoked over hickory wood for authentic flavor. You might know them for their Utah Sconuts - light, airy pastry bread topped with homemade honey butter - and an impressive selection of 22 different sauces made onsite. Generous portions and a warm, family-style atmosphere make every meal feel like a home-cooked feast."
