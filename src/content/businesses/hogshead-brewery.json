  "notes": "Neighborhood brewery specializing in English-style cask ales and West Coast IPAs. Known for their four flagship beers: Chin Wag ESB, a dangerously quaffable session beer perfect for conversation; Gilpin Black Gold, a dark and beautiful London Porter with notes of dark cocoa, coffee, and dark fruits; Lake Lightning, a clean English Pale Ale with biscuity malts and herbal hops that can go in all sorts of directions on cask; and Hog Wild, a bold West Coast IPA that makes Colorado proud. Each beer is crafted with care, offering everything from creamy porters to hop-forward IPAs."
