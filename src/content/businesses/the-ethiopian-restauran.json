Guests can enjoy classic dishes built around spongy injera bread, perfect for scooping up richly spiced stews and vegetable plates. With vegan and vegetarian options, halal choices, and a full bar that includes wine and spirits, it’s a cozy spot for anyone looking to experience authentic Ethiopian cooking in a relaxed, welcoming setting."
