  "notes": "TTaste the Love Cooking is led by Angela, a Kansas City, Missouri native bringing her own style of barbecue and soul food to the Denver area. Her cooking is inspired by childhood memories of big family gatherings where everything — from appetizers to dessert — was cooked on the grill, and Sunday dinners at a local barbecue spot where the weekly specials were always a fun surprise. She now shares that same warm, home-style experience with her customers."
