  "notes": "Kabod is an Ethiopian specialty coffee roaster located at Concourse B of Denver International Airport. Every cup begins on small, family-owned farms in the heart of Ethiopia - the birthplace of coffee. Kabod sources only 100% organic, single-source beans, with each harvest coming from one distinct region and never blended with coffee from other farms. From selecting sun-dried green coffee beans to careful local roasting, every step honors a true farm-to-cup experience, delivering unparalleled freshness, authenticity, and a taste that tells the story of its origin."
